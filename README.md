# Comet 

## What is it?
Comet is an extremely small interpretable programming language. It is compiled
into a byte code and then the code is executed in a very small virtual machine
that can be run even on an 8-bit microcontroller. Unlike basic, it is 
translated into byte code, which ensures that performance does not depend on
the length of variable or function names. Additionally, an interpreter is not
required when using Comet on a microcontroller, the program code can be 
translated on a computer, and only a virtual machine runs on the 
microcontroller.
